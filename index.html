    <main> <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell.
      The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the
      order, which is part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the
      anteaters and sloths. The word armadillo means "little armoured one"
      in Spanish.
</p>
<p>About nine extant genera and 21 extant species of armadillo have been
  described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their
  armour. Their average length is about 75 cm (30 in), including tail.
  All species are native to the Americas, where they inhabit a variety
  of different environments.
</p>
<p>Recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured
  mammals, the glyptodonts, should be included within the lineage of armadillos,
  having diverged some 35 million years ago, much more recently than
  previously assumed.
