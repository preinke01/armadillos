      <h3>History</h3>
      <p id="History">
Armadillos originated in South America. Due to the continent's former
isolation, they were confined there for most of the Cenozoic. The recent
formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed a few members of the family to
migrate northward into southern North America by the early Pleistocene, as
part of the Great American Interchange.
</p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p id="Distribution">Today, all extant armadillo species are still present in
  South America. They are particularly diverse in Paraguay
  (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered.

  Some, including four species of Dasypus, are widely distributed over the
  Americas, whereas others, such as Yepes's mulita, are restricted to small
  ranges. Two species, the northern naked-tailed armadillo and nine-banded
  armadillo, are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the
  United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but
  with a range that extends as far east as South Carolina and Florida, and as
  far north as Nebraska and central Indiana. Their range has consistently
  expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural
  predators.
</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<p id="Types">Armadillos are small to medium-sized mammals. The smallest
  species, the pink fairy armadillo, is roughly chipmunk-sized at 85 g (
  3.0 oz) and 13–15 cm (5.1–5.9 in) in total length. The largest species,
  the giant armadillo, can be the size of a small pig and weigh up to 54 kg
  (119 lb), and can be 150 cm (59 in) long.</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p id="Habitat">They are prolific diggers. Many species use their sharp claws
  to dig for food, such as grubs, and to dig dens. The nine-banded armadillo
  prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks, streams, and arroyos
  around which it lives and feeds. </p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p id="Diet">The diets of different armadillo species vary, but consist mainly
   of insects, grubs, and other invertebrates. Some species, however, feed
   almost entirely on ants and termites.
</p>
<h3>Anatomy</h3>
<p id="Anatomy">In common with other xenarthrans, armadillos, in general, have
  low body temperatures of 33–36 °C (91–97 °F) and low basal metabolic rates
  (40–60% of that expected in placental mammals of their mass). This is
  particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their
  primary food source.
</p>
<img src="armadillo_4.png" alt="arm 4">
<p>Armadillos have very poor eyesight, and use their keen sense of smell to
  hunt for food. They use their claws for digging and finding food, as well
  as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws,
   making only a single corridor the width of the animal's body. They have five
   clawed toes on their hind feet, and three to five toes with heavy digging
   claws on their fore feet. Armadillos have a large number of cheek teeth
   which are not divided into premolars and molars, but usually have no incisors
    or canines.</p>
<p>The armour is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small,
  overlapping epidermal scales called "scutes", composed of bone with a covering
  of horn. Most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with
  a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks.
  Additional armour covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs,
  and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armoured, and is simply
  covered with soft skin and fur.
</p>
<h3>Defense</h3>
<p id="Defense">This armour-like skin appears to be the main defense of many
  armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into
  thorny patches, from which their armour protects them) or digging to safety.
  Only the South American three-banded armadillos (Tolypeutes) rely heavily on
  their armour for protection. When threatened by a predator, Tolypeutes
  species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot
  roll up because they have too many plates. The North American nine-banded
  armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, so consequently
  often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles.
</p>
<p>Armadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The nine-banded
  armadillo is noted for its movement through water which is accomplished
  via two different methods: it can walk underwater for short distances,
  holding its breath for as long as six minutes; also, to cross larger
  bodies of water, it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing
  air, inflating its stomach and intestines.
</p>

<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p id="Reproduction">Gestation lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species,
  although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation, so the
  young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of
  the genus Dasypus give birth to four monozygotic young (that is, identical
  quadruplets), but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from
  one to eight. The young are born with soft, leathery skin which hardens
  within a few weeks. They reach sexual maturity in three to 12 months,
  depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not
  share their burrows with other adults.
</p>
<p>The nine-banded armadillo serves science through its unusual reproductive
  system, in which four genetically identical offspring are born, the result
  of one original egg. Because they are always genetically identical, the
  group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral,
  or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in
  the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of polyembryony
  in the class Mammalia, and exists only within the genus Dasypus and not
  in all armadillos, as is commonly believed.
